/*
Implement a C++ function that takes a person's income as an argument and returns their tax bracket using if-else statements.

Define tax brackets based on income:
Income ≤ ₹2,50,000: .
₹2,50,001 - ₹5,00,000: .
₹5,00,001 - ₹10,00,000: .
Income > ₹10,00,000: .  


₹2,00,000 → No tax.
₹3,00,000 → 5% of ₹50,000 = ₹2,500.
₹7,00,000 → 20% of ₹2,00,000 = ₹40,000.
₹12,00,000 → 30% of ₹2,00,000 = ₹60,000.

//Implement a C++ function that takes the number of hours a car is parked as an argument and returns the parking fee based on hourly rates using if-else statements.
/*
Define the hourly parking fee structure as follows:
First 2 hours: ₹20 per hour.
Next 3 hours: ₹15 per hour.
Beyond 5 hours: ₹10 per hour.
For example:
1 hour → ₹10
3 hours → ₹20 + ₹15 = ₹35
6 hours → ₹20 (2 hours) + ₹15 (3 hours) + ₹10 (1 hour) = ₹85
